
 Weather Monitoring System

 Project Overview

This project is a Weather Monitoring System that fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities, processes the information, checks for weather alerts, and stores the data in a database. Additionally, it generates visualizations of the data. The project is containerized using Docker and can be developed inside a fully configured GitHub Codespace.

 Prerequisites

To set up this project, you will need:
1. Git installed on your machine.
2. GitHub Codespaces (optional) or a local environment set up for Docker and Python.
3. OpenWeatherMap API key (create an account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your API key).

 Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project in your development environment.

 Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine or open it directly in a GitHub Codespace.

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring-system.git
cd weather-monitoring-system


 Step 2: Set Up the Project Locally (Using Docker)

This project uses Docker to ensure that the environment is consistent across different machines. Follow these steps to set it up using Docker:

1. Build and Run the Docker Containers:
   Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine, then run the following commands:

   bash
   docker-compose up --build
   

   This command will:
   - Build the application container from the `Dockerfile`.
   - Create a PostgreSQL container for storing the weather data.
   - Start both the containers and link them using Docker Compose.

2. Run the Application:
   The application will automatically run inside the Docker container and fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for multiple cities, process the data, and check for weather alerts.

3. Stop the Containers:
   When you're done, you can stop the containers with:

   bash
   docker-compose down
   

 Step 3: Setting Up GitHub Codespaces

If you prefer to use GitHub Codespaces for development, follow these steps:

1. Open Codespace:
   Go to your GitHub repository page, click the green `Code` button, and select `Open with Codespaces`. If it's your first time using Codespaces, follow the on-screen instructions.

2. Run the Application:
   Codespaces will automatically set up the environment as configured in the `.devcontainer` folder, including installing dependencies and creating the Docker containers.

3. Configure API Key:
   Once inside Codespaces, open the `config.json` file and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   json
   {
       "api_key": "your_openweathermap_api_key",
       "alert_threshold": 35
   }
   

4. Run the Project:
   You can run the project directly in Codespaces using:
   bash
   python src/main.py
   

 Step 4: Running Tests

This project comes with unit tests to ensure each module works as expected.

1. Run all the tests:
   To run the test suite, execute the following command:

   bash
   python -m unittest discover -s src/test
   

   This will run all the test cases, including:
   - Fetching weather data.
   - Processing weather data.
   - Checking alerts based on temperature thresholds.

 Step 5: Setting Up Dependencies

The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. If you're working locally (without Docker), you can install them using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


 Step 6: Configuration

The project configuration is stored in `config.json`. This file contains settings such as:
- Your OpenWeatherMap API key.
- Temperature alert thresholds.

Edit the `config.json` file as needed before running the application.

Example `config.json` file:

json
{
   "api_key": "your_openweathermap_api_key",
   "alert_threshold": 35
}


 Step 7: Project Execution

Once the project is set up, you can fetch, process, and store weather data by running the main application:

bash
python src/main.py


The system will:
- Fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Process the data (temperature conversions, condition aggregation, etc.).
- Check for weather alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Store daily weather summaries in a PostgreSQL database.

 Step 8: Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop the Docker containers and remove them, use the following command:

bash
docker-compose down --volumes


This will also remove the volumes created for storing PostgreSQL data.

 Future Enhancements

- Additional City Support: Add more cities or regions to monitor.
- Improved Alerting: Integrate an email or SMS alert system when weather conditions meet certain criteria.
- Advanced Visualization: Add more advanced weather data visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib.
- Data Export: Include options to export weather summaries to CSV or JSON formats.

This process should guide users step by step to set up and run the project locally, in Docker, or in Codespaces, as well as running tests and customizing configurations.
